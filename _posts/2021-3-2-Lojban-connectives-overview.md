title: bridi connectives in Lojban
---

I'm currently learning Lojban and one topic that has given
me some trouble have been connectives, especially between .
By writing this post I'd like to gather all my understanding
of the grammar of Lojban connectives in one place.  The
system I'm working in is CLL extended with the [simplified
connective system][1] by selpahi; all further deviations are
mistakes on my part.

Throughout the post I'll use X and Y to denote arbitrary
bridi.

# Sentence links

The easiest way to connect two bridi is to put them into
sentences one after the other.  The standard sentence
connective is {X .i Y}.  This does not imply any explicit
relation between the two.

# Open questions

There's still some stuff I don't understand.  The main point
is the difference between {.i} and {gi} when it comes to
sentences.  As we've seen, {gi} allows for more forethought
connections, but what, for example, does {X gi Y gi Z} mean,
and how does it differ from {X .i gi Y gi Z}?

A few other things I'm not sure about:

- {ku'i gi X gi Y}
- {gi ku'i bo X gi Y}
- {gi X ku'i gi Y}
