The English definition of {cilre} in la sutysisku is [as
follows][0]:

> cilre: _x1_ learns _x2_ (du'u) about subject _x3_ from
> source _x4_ (object/event) by method _x5_ (event/process).

This is great when what you're learning is a proposition.
(zo'o You'd almost think Lojban was built around those!)
mu'a

> mi cilre lo du'u lo terdi cu bolci
>
> I learned that the Earth is a sphere.

ku'i this is only one of the things one may want to say
about learning.  What about the following the following
types of learning?

* "I learned how to speak Lojban."
* "I learned about Gödel."
* "I learned the word for 'cat'."

.i ganzu ti poi selkarni ku'o fo lo si'o danfu
.o pe'u mi tercusku lo do sidbo

## {tadni}

zo'o The easiest way to avoid saying you learned anything is
to declare yourself a student.

> ca lo ctununta'a ku mi tadni la'oi Gödel
>
> "During the lecture, we studied Gödel."

As long as you don't need to make any claims that the
studying had a particular outcome, this is a promising
approach.  The main downside seems to be the ambiguity about
whether "study" is intended as an activity or a lifestyle,
so this needs to be clear from context.

## {zenba}

The opposite approach is to focus on the outcome rather than
the process.

> mi zenba lo ka ke'a kakne tu'a lo jbobau
>
> I increased in [my] capability of doing something with
> Lojban.

This communicates the result, but it doesn't say you
acquired this through learning: maybe you got a translation
device.  Of course, you can clarify this with a tanru like
{mi nuntadni zenba …} or a modal.

(ji'a I'm not quite sure how broadly the community agrees
with this interpretation.  {zenba}, like {mutce} and
{zmadu}, seems to be somewhat contentious in its
interpretation.  I'll probably write about this in more
detail later.)

## Tenses

Taking a more extreme approach, you can simply declare
you're now capable of something.

> mi co'a kakne tu'a lo jbobau
>
> I am at the starting point of being capable of doing
> something with Lojban.

It's not clear that {co'a} is really the best word to use
here.
Perhaps {ba'o co'a}, "I am in the aftermath of
becoming capable of doing something with Lojban," would be
better.
pe'i .I would really like a tense construct for {zenba},
that is, a cmavo _Z_ such that {mi _Z_ kakne} means "I am on
the upwards slope of becoming capable."
Again, this deserves its own post (and would need a bunch of
extra vocabulary).

Adding {ri'a lo nuntadni} here would clarify that the
what created this capability was study.  (Something about me
says {rinka} isn't great here, but I do think it's
technically correct, and maybe this is just the Lojbanic way
of thinking?)  This, however, raises the following issue...

## A note on {kakne}

Learning how to speak Lojban is not a guarantee you are
capable of speaking it; mu'a you may be asleep or gagged.
I think this is not a real issue since Lojban distinguishes
potentiality and actuality.  Learning makes one {ka'e
kakne}, but not necessarily {ca'a kakne}.

Still, "I've learned how to drive, I just can't right now" is a
sentence that you might want to say.  It seems like avoiding
the {kakne} in this case may be the better way to go,
instead going back to the {tadni} route.

Another approach is to formulate things not as you being
merely capable of something, but being an expert at it.
This sidesteps the problem of whether you can actually do it
or not, but there's a big gap between learning something and
becoming an expert at it.  (Here too, an increasing tense
would be more fitting.)

## {menpo'e}

What about cases when you do want to say that there's some
result, but the result is you gaining something other than
factual knowledge or particular skills.  mu'a what about
gaining understanding?

There's a broader issue here that applies to {djuno},
{jimpe}, and so on, and that really deserves its own post.
I think the way to go is to consider some kind of mental
possesion of the concepts involved.  I think "I know the
word cat" should be translated as something akin to:

> mi menpo'e zo mlatu

However, it's not clear which lujvo exactly to use for this.
Perhaps {ralte} or {jitro} work better than {ponse}, and
{sidbo} could work better than {menli}.
