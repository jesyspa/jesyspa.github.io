title: Plans for this blog

As I'm learning more and more Lojban, I'm noticing that
there's some stuff I need to write down for future
reference and some stuff I'd like to reimagine.  Moreover,
Lojban really puts my worldview to the test, and I'd like to
write that out.  Splitting the posts I have in mind in
roughly these categories, here's a TODO list for myself:

Stuff I need to write down for reference (and to check it's
actually correct):

* Grammatical rules for connectives.
* Vocabulary for non-factual equivalents of {djuno},
  {cilre}, etc.  (E.g. how do I say "I don't know how to say
  that"?)
* Vocabulary for common emotions, including rules for
  {uinmo} and friends.

Stuff that I'm probabling bankling that I should better
understand and document:

* My interpretation of negation.
* My understanding of if-then and iff.
* My understanding of existential import.
* My interpretation of {ka}.
* Imperatives in the context of modals.
* Rising and falling tenses ("become more X").

Finally, the more philosophical questions I'd like to go
into are why I reject excluded middle and instead take all
functions to be continuous, and what kind of effect that has
on my view of language and the world.

To give myself something of a goal to work towards, I think
I'd like to make a post once every two weeks, with the first
one due... let's say this Sunday, the 14th.
