Before posting anything about [Lojban][0], I wanted to make a
post clarifying in what ways I'll be deviating from the
[CLL][1].  I'll keep this post updated as my language
changes.  At the moment, the changes I'm aware of using are:

1. [xorlo][2]
2. [Selpahi's simplified connectives system][3]
3. [.ajbo / New sentence links][4]

If you see me using a modification that isn't on here,
please let me know!  Either I'm making a mistake and then
I'd like to correct it, or I'm doing it intentionally and
should add it here in order to be understood.
